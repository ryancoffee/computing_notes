coffee@coffee-ThinkPad-X260:~$ sudo systemctl edit cups-browsed.service 

add to the file (possible a new file)

[Service]
TimeoutStopSec=10

then do a 

coffee@coffee-ThinkPad-X260:~$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
coffee@coffee-ThinkPad-X260:~$ sudo systemctl stop cups-browsed.service 
coffee@coffee-ThinkPad-X260:~$ sudo systemctl start cups-browsed.service 

then try shutting down and see if it is faster.
